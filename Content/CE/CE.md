It is great to note that the 3rd edition of online “Newsletter” is being published, which will be a compilation of all achievements of various departments/sections. The efforts of the Editorial Team is highly appreciable.
</p>

<p align=justify>
Our vision is to prepare every student for the construction industry and for that our faculty keep updating their knowledge by attending conferencing / workshops / seminars and also contributing to the knowledge pool by conducting research. Our department is committed to providing students with a strong, broad-based fundamental engineering education, using cutting edge technologies and modern equipment. That coupled with dedicated efforts of staff and faculty results in excellent outcomes, which make our students shine in every nook and corner of this planet.
</p>

<p align=justify>
We also impart entrepreneurial skills to students through summer internships/workshops, so that they would drive the spirit of growth of our economy and would be able to generate employment opportunities for other qualified and skilled people.
</p>
<p align=justify>
I ensure on behalf of my faculty colleagues and staff that we will continue to strive for greater heights in teaching and research that is relevant and shall help in nation-building.
</p>

## Department at Glimpse

### UKIERI Concrete Congress  

Department of Civil Engineering, GNDEC alongwith NIT, Jalandhar hosted 5th UKIERI Concrete Congress on **Sustainable Concrete Infrastructure** from March 14-17,2023 in virtual mode. Concrete, being the most powerful material for construction, should have minimal toxic impact on the environment. Keeping this in mind, abundant ideas with feasible solutions were presented by reseachers across world. Dr. Sehijpal Singh, Principal, GNDEC and Dr, H. S. Rai, Head of the Department of Civil Engineering, GNDEC acted as patron and co-patron for this
